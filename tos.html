Each of the Virtual Items perform different functions on the Service, and each may be subject to their own terms and conditions, as specified in these Terms or otherwise on the Service. They also have some things in common.  All Virtual Items are not money and do not entitle any person to any payment. While we may use terms like “buy”, “purchase”, or “sell” in reference to some Virtual Items, such uses are merely for convenience and do not mean that Virtual Items have any particular value. When you “send” a Prop, you are sending it to us to display and register your approval of the referenced content or Broadcast. The Service may enable you to react to Broadcasters, other Users, Broadcasts, or User Content using Props, but all transfers of Virtual Items between Users (including through the transfer of accounts on the Service) are expressly prohibited, including any sale or exchange, whether direct or through an intermediary, such as an auction service. Virtual Items are provided to you for entertainment purposes only, and we grant you a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable license to use any Virtual Items you obtain or access only on the Service. Virtual Items are not real property, and, as between you and Caffeine, Caffeine owns all right, title, and interest in all Virtual Items on the Service.

When a Broadcaster’s Broadcast receives a Prop through the Service from other Users, a User uses Gold to access Premium Content offered by the Broadcaster, or Caffeine rewards a Broadcaster for other eligible activities on the Service at its discretion, Credits may be added to the Broadcaster’s account on the Service.

Caffeine may, at its discretion, place restrictions on your ability to Redeem, reject any request you make for Redemption, and determine how much you are eligible to Redeem. For example, Caffeine generally limits a Broadcaster’s ability to Redeem $1,000 or more per day and may deny your Redemption request in excess of that amount. Any Broadcaster requesting to Redeem $1,000 or more worth of Credits in any given day will need to provide information to Caffeine for Caffeine to conduct certain checks and verifications on the Broadcaster. This information may include, at Caffeine’s discretion, your bank name and account, the address of your primary residence, your full legal name, a government-issued identification number, tax information (an IRS form W-9 for U.S. taxpayers and an IRS form W-8 BEN for non-U.S. taxpayers), and copies or images of related documents (as well as any of the same information from any media company representing a Broadcaster, as applicable) (“</span><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-skip-ink:none">Verification Documentation</span></strong><span style="font-size:11pt;font-weight:400">”). Caffeine reserves the right to decline or cancel any Redemption request for any reason, including if the Verification Documentation appears to be inaccurate, cannot be verified, does not uniquely identify you or, as applicable, the media company representing a Broadcaster, or that a Redemption request would be, as determined by Caffeine at its discretion, inappropriate. For example, Caffeine may deny Redemption requests that involve suspected money laundering or suspicious or fraudulent account activity or payments of $1,000 or more in any given day. Certain age restrictions may also apply to the availability of Redemption opportunities, depending on local laws and the policies of Caffeine’s third-party vendors. Even if you request to Redeem, you will only receive Gold or U.S. dollars, as applicable, in exchange for Credits held in your account if Caffeine determines, at its discretion, that you are eligible to Redeem. You may incur transaction fees in connection with Redemption transactions, and these fees will vary depending on the payment method you choose. Except as otherwise set forth in a written and signed agreement entered into between a Broadcaster and Caffeine, Caffeine may also impose restrictions on Redemption requests, such as requirements regarding: (a) the amount or quality of content that must be provided by a Broadcaster prior to a Redemption; (b) the length of time that the Broadcaster has been active in, or the amount and quality of the Broadcaster's participation in, the Caffeine community prior to a Redemption request; (c) whether the Broadcaster is currently active on the Service; (d)  a minimum number of Credits that a Broadcaster may Redeem per Redemption; and (e) Broadcaster's compliance with all the provisions of these Terms.</span></h2>

If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.</span></h2>

For example, Caffeine generally limits a Broadcaster&rsquo;s ability to Redeem $1,000 or more per day and may deny your Redemption request in excess of that amount. Any Broadcaster requesting to Redeem $1,000 or more worth of Credits in any given day will need to provide information to Caffeine for Caffeine to conduct certain checks and verifications on the Broadcaster. This information may include, at Caffeine&rsquo;s discretion, your bank name and account, the address of your primary residence, your full legal name, a government-issued identification number, tax information (an IRS form W-9 for U.S. taxpayers and an IRS form W-8 BEN for non-U.S. taxpayers), and copies or images of related documents (as well as any of the same information from any media company representing a Broadcaster, as applicable) (&ldquo;</span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;\">Verification Documentation</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 400;\">&rdquo;). Caffeine reserves the right to decline or cancel any Redemption request for any reason, including if the Verification Documentation appears to be inaccurate, cannot be verified, does not uniquely identify you or, as applicable, the media company representing a Broadcaster, or that a Redemption request would be, as determined by Caffeine at its discretion, inappropriate. For example, Caffeine may deny Redemption requests that involve suspected money laundering or suspicious or fraudulent account activity or payments of $1,000 or more in any given day. Certain age restrictions may also apply to the availability of Redemption opportunities, depending on local laws and the policies of Caffeine&rsquo;s third-party vendors. Even if you request to Redeem, you will only receive Gold or U.S. dollars, as applicable, in exchange for Credits held in your account if Caffeine determines, at its discretion, that you are eligible to Redeem. You may incur transaction fees in connection with Redemption transactions, and these fees will vary depending on the payment method you choose. Except as otherwise set forth in a written and signed agreement entered into between a Broadcaster and Caffeine, Caffeine may also impose restrictions on Redemption requests, such as requirements regarding: (a)&nbsp;the amount or quality of content that must be provided by a Broadcaster prior to a Redemption; (b)&nbsp;the length of time that the Broadcaster has been active in, or the amount and quality of the Broadcaster's participation in, the Caffeine community prior to a Redemption request; (c)&nbsp;whether the Broadcaster is currently active on the Service; (d)&nbsp; a minimum number of Credits that a Broadcaster may Redeem per Redemption; and (e)&nbsp;Broadcaster's compliance with all the provisions of these Terms.</span></h2>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; margin-left: -36pt;\">\r\n<h2 role=\"presentation\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">7.4 Your Representations, Warranties, and Acknowledgements</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 400;\">.

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Caffeine in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Sections&nbsp;18.2 and 18.4, you and Caffeine agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms or the use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CAFFEINE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</span></h2>\r\n<ol start=\"2\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-inline-start: 48px;\">\r\n<li style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\">\r\n<h2 role=\"presentation\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">18.2 Exceptions</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 400;\">.

The Notice of Arbitration must: (a)&nbsp;identify the user&rsquo;s username on the Service; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (&ldquo;</span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;\">Demand</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 400;\">&rdquo;). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Caffeine may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Caffeine will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if Caffeine has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.</span></h2>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\">\r\n<h2 role=\"presentation\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">18.6 Arbitration Proceedings</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 400;\">.

During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Caffeine must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
